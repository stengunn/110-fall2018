# Research Paper

In this assignment, you will select a topic related to interactive media, identify or formulate an argument about it, find supporting evidence for your argument, and write a 5-7 page paper on the topic. 

Here are some examples of the types of arguments you could make:
- "Photoshop is the most important tool for interactive designers to learn." 
- "[Book/Movie Title] was hugely influential in the development of XXX media." 
- "[Technology Type] will be the next big thing in interactive media." 
- "[Technology Type] is an overhyped topic in interactive media.") 

 Be sure to select an appropriate topic; one where you can find sufficient resources--online and/or offline--and, ideally, one with some originality. (That means VR/AR are probably not a good choice, for instance, since I've gotten so many papers on that in the past two years!) If you're having trouble thinking of a suitable topic, feel free to contact me for help.

Write the paper in your own words. Any external sources that you quote should be clearly attributed. If you plagiarize any of the paper, you will fail not only this assignment, but the entire course. We'll be talking about what does and does not constitute plagiarism in class. 
  
Be creative, and (despite what you may have been told in high school) don't be afraid to be personal. You do not need to write a highly formal paper. Writing in the first person is encouraged. Explain why you chose this topic--what meaning and importance does it have for you? What did you find out in doing your research that you didn't know before? Don't just summarize the facts that you find...that increases your risk of plagiarism, and decreases your chances of a high grade. Instead, do the research, then put the books and printouts away, and think about how you'd explain to your best friend or your parent what's important or compelling about the topic you've chosen. Make me care about the topic. 

You must, however, support your opinions and assertions with citations to valid external sources. You should provide the source for any quotations or factual information (even if it's not a quotation) that you include in your paper. Your bibliography must include a *minimum* of eight sources, with at least four of those sources being edited, respected sources (books, journals, magazines, newspapers, well-edited websites). You may not use reference/tertiary sources (such as encyclopedias or dictionaries)--while it's fine to use them for your research, you should check the original sources they draw from, and use those for your citations. When in doubt about a source, ask me! You will also need to provide a brief (no more than one paragraph) annotation for each reference, explaining how it was useful for your paper. 

## Deliverables

### Topic Idea: Due before midnight on Monday, September 4th
A very basic statement of your topic and a brief description or outline of your approach to the paper need to be turned in by 11:59pm on Monday 9/4. This is not a graded assignment, but if you do not turn it in, you'll lose 15% off your final paper grade. I will review your topic to be sure that it's appropriate and manageable, and will provide feedback by Thursday 9/6. 

### First Draft: Due before midnight on Monday, September 11th 
By midnight on 9/11, put a copy of your first draft in your group's Google Docs folder. At a *minimum*, the draft should include an introductory paragraph, and a full outline of your intended content. The more you include, however, the more useful the feedback you get will be. You must review and comment on all of your group members' drafts before Friday afternoon. This is a good way to see examples of other students' approaches to the assignment, as well as to get peer feedback before turning in your final paper. Again, while the assignment will not be graded, if you don't upload a draft **and** participate in the peer review  you'll lose 15% of your final paper grade.

### Second Draft (optional): Due before midnight on Friday, September 15th
If you would like feedback from me on your draft, incorporate the feedback received from your group and submit a revised draft to the Paper Draft dropbox in myCourses by 5pm on Friday (9/15). (I will check Google Docs for evidence that you have incorporated your group's feedback.) If you submit a draft, I will provide feedback by midnight on Monday (9/18). 

### Final Paper: Due before midnight on Sunday, September 24th 
The final version of your paper is due by midnight on Sunday 9/24. Upload an electronic copy of the paper in the myCourses  dropbox. It must be in Word (.doc, .docx), rich text format (.rtf), or PDF--not Open Office (.odf), Apple Pages or any other non-standard format. Most word processing programs (including Google Docs and Open Office) will allow you to save a file in PDF or RTF format.  

Here are the content and formatting requirements for the paper: 
  	
  - The minimum length for the body of the paper (not including the title page, abstract, or bibliographic references) is five full pages. A page must have at least 275 words on it to count as a full page, which means that the paper should have no fewer than 1375 words. There is not a maximum length cutoff, but I would prefer that the paper not exceed 3,000 words. 
  - You must use a style manual to format your paper, footnotes/endnotes, and bibliography. You can use whichever standard style you'd like--APA, MLA, Chicago, Turabian, etc. For more information on style manuals and citing sources, consult the RIT Library style guide references at http://infoguides.rit.edu/citationguide, come to my office hours, or talk to a librarian at the Wallace Library. 
  - Include a bibliography of all articles, books, and online resources you use to research your topic. This bibliography should include any reference that you cite in your paper. Use your chosen style manual's format for your bibliographic references. 
  - You must include at least eight references in your bibliography, and a minimum of four of those references should be to high-quality edited sources--books, magazine or journal articles, or newspaper articles, all properly cited. The other four sources can be (but do not have to be) more informal web-based sources. You *may not* count reference books or websites such as encyclopedias or dictionaries (tertiary sources) towards your eight references. 
  - All bibliography entries should include a brief annotation describing the nature of the work and how it was relevant to your paper.
  - Proofread and edit your writing. Spelling and grammatical errors will count against your grade.
