# Alternate Digital Audio Exercise

This exercise introduces you to the process of adding captions or subtitles to a video.  

You will need to produce captions for an ~80-second video generated from a five-slide PowerPoint presentation--16 seconds of narration for each of 5 slides.  


## Creating the Files

1. Download and decompress the [archive of sample presentations](sample-ignites.zip).  
- Each presentation has 6 slides: An intro/title slide, 4 presentation slides, and a credits slide at the end. 
- Choose the set of slides you want to work with.  You can choose from Chocolate, Dr. Who, Star Wars or Nintendo. Don't worry too much about the content of the narration--this is about process rather than content, so your content doesn't even have to be accurate! (Yes, if you absolutely must, you can change the slides and use a different topic. But remember the goal of this exercise is learning to create captions/subtitles, so spending a lot of time on content production isn't necessary or wise.)
2. In a plain text file, write a script to accompany the presentation. The narration for each slide should fit in a reasonable way within the time constraints (15 seconds per slide). 
3. Use the Save As... option in Powerpoint to save your presentation as an .mp4 video. 


## Uploading to YouTube and Creating Subtitles/Captions
We're going to use YouTube's built-in tools to help with captioning of videos. 

1. Log into YouTube and upload the .mp4 file that you created from your presentation. Make sure you set the visibility to unlisted, so that we'll be able to grade it. ([YouTube video uploading instructions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en))

2. Once the upload has completed, click on the "Video Manager" link at the bottom of the screen. (You can also get to this page by clicking on your account icon in the top right corner of the screen and choosing "Creator Studio", and clicking the "Edit" button next to the video.)

3. From the menu at the top of the edit screen, choose the "Subtitles/CC" option. 

4. Click on "Add New Subtitles or CC", and select English as the language. You'll be prompted for a method. 
 - "Upload a file" allows you to upload a transcript or existing subtitle file . YouTube will automatically try to match the text in your file with any audio in the file, after which you can edit the timings. Since you have no audio in this file, this won't work particularly well. 
 - "Transcribe and Auto-Sync" allows you to transcribe the audio of the video real-time. The "set timings" button then does the same thing as the upload file option--it tries to match your text with the audio in the video.
 - "Create New Subitles or CC" allows you to type in subtitles/captions one at a time, at the location in the video that you want them to appear.  

 5. You're going to use the "Create New Subtitles or CC". Before proceeding, I recommend watching this 1-minute tutorial video: [Creating Subtitles and Closed Captions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZ-cxfxzvk)

 6. Create captions for your video by copying and pasting lines of your script into captions at appropriate points in the video.   

 7. When you're done, preview the video, to see how it looks. Make any necessary edits or additions.

 8. Once you're satisfied with your captions, click on the "Actions" menu and save the subtitle file in either .srt or .vtt format. (You can read more about the two formats here: http://www.3playmedia.com/2015/03/05/caption-format-acronyms-explained/)


## Submitting your files
Once you're done, upload the .mp4 and .srt files to the dropbox for week 12. In the description for the submission, include the URL to the YouTube video. 

If you choose to work on this on your own rather than coming to class on Thursday, the files and link must be submitted to the myCourses dropbox by the beginning of Thursday's class. If you come to class on Thursday, the exercise is due by 6pm on Saturday, November 18th.
