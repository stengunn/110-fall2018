# Digital Video Editing Exercise

Using Photoshop's digital video editing capabilities, make a short trailer for a game of your choice (real or imagined). It can be a digital game or a board game. You should make use of existing audio and video assets that you are able to find on the Web so that the focus is on assembling a video and the use of the editing tools and final compression, and not on capturing video and audio.  

*Note: If you already have experience editing video, and would prefer to use a different video editing tool (e.g. Premiere or Avid's digital video suite), you are free to use that as long as you fulfill the basic requirements of the exercise.*



Your video must meet the following requirements:
1.	Begin with a title screen (text on a background or text over an image/video clip).
2.	Include at least one audio track (music or narration).  
3.	Incorporate a minimum of four motion video clips and/or still images in the video track. At least one of the clips must be a still image. 
4.	Animate at least one still image using panning, zooming or a combination of the two, i.e, the "Ken Burns effect," as discussed in class.  
5.	Use transitions between clips (simple cross fades are fine).
6.	End with a closing credits screen that shows your name as well as credits for any assets used in the video.
7.	Have a total length of at least 30 seconds and no more than 60 seconds.

When you've completed the video editing, use "Export -> Render Video" to save the video using the H.264 codec. Use the HDTV preset (1280x720) at high quality. Upload your completed video file to YouTube. If you used copyrighted materials, or would prefer that the video not be visible to others, you should upload it as an "unlisted" video--not as a "private" video, because then we can't grade it. (Once you've received your grade for the assignment, you are welcome to delete the video if you'd like.)

# Submitting Your Work
Provide the YouTube URL for the video via the "Week 14 Video Exercise" quiz in myCourses.  

If you choose to work on this on your own rather than coming to class on Thursday, you must submit the URL  by the beginning of Thursday's class. If you come to class on Thursday, you must submit the URL by 6pm on Saturday, December 2nd.
